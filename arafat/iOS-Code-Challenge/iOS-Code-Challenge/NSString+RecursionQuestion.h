 ### Recursion
 Suppose you are solving the same problem as above but instead of an array you are getting the strings from another object.
 This object has a method nextLastName, that returns a string of the next last name or nil if there aren't anymore names.
 
 #### Objective 1
 Add method that gets all of the last names, and returns a BOOL, like the last
 
 **Return**: TRUE or FALSE after all last names have been examined
 
 #### Objective 2
 Do not use a do, while, enumerator or for statement in your method.
 
 **Return**: TRUE or FALSE after all last names have been examined
